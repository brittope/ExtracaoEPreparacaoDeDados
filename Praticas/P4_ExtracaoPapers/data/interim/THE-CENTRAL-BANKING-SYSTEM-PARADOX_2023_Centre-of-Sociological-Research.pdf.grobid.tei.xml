system, thus emerging the stabilityefficiency thesis paradox. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> The theory begins with a hypothetical equilibrium over time in the production structure, deriving the predictable results of a central bank disruption of that equilibrium.</s><s xml:id="_UB6Zxny">Thus, the canonical theory focuses on (1) the time structure of production, (2) the potential for credit inflation to alter the relative prices of current versus future goods, and (3) a misallocation of resources between production processes that require more or less time.</s><s

achieved in shorter time processes.</s><s xml:id="_uDn9skX">For example, Robinson Crusoe can hunt (consumer good) with his bare hands, but he will be much more productive if he has a spear (capital good).</s><s xml:id="_ns93qZx">This production process requires time from obtaining the given products of nature (capital goods) to combining them and obtaining the spear.</s></p><p xml:id="_dCqNdJY"><s xml:id="_ugd5Asx">Improvements in the quality and quantity of consumer goods available in the economy mean developed stages in increasingly complex production structures,

xml:id="_fSCMDrr">It signals entrepreneurs which investment projects are relatively the most profitable.</s><s xml:id="_C9PEBDC">A high degree of impatience (low level of saving) means a higher preference for present goods than future goods, which tends to raise the interest rate.</s><s xml:id="_wKnTZVw">A low time preference (higher level of savings) shows a greater relative preference for future goods than for present goods, which tends to reduce the interest rate.</s><s xml:id="_ataXpHS">Since the agents' decisions to save imply their consumption decisions, a fall in the market interest rate will tend to coordinate the investment profit promises of entrepreneurs in a more capital-intensive production structure with the time preferences of consumers intertemporally.</s><s

greater demand in the future as if previous savings in the economy had increased, something that did not happen.</s><s xml:id="_H6mshBu">On the other hand, consumers judge that they can execute more direct plans with more favorable credit conditions.</s><s xml:id="_8n82B89">This intertemporal discoordination denotes the boom phase of the ABCT.</s></p><p xml:id="_mf4Uy7Q"><s xml:id="_u7g5M95">The

be completed and demanded.</s><s xml:id="_2BcP3pY">By game theory, if banks can operate on fractional reserve and firms can access cheap credit, the best answer is for the bank to expand credit and

competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Van Den Hauwe, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_KxDfR2R"><s xml:id="_GwurAPu">When cheap credit enters the economy through the demand of entrepreneurs to finance the production of future goods, the prices of the most roundabout capital goods tend to rise concerning the prices of goods closest to final consumption.</s><s xml:id="_asSAUN7">This boom induces an artificial increase in the expected profitability of the most roundabout projects from final consumption.</s><s xml:id="_r5UztK3">Entrepreneurs tend to reallocate resources (e.g., labor) towards more roundabout production processes, increasing the stages of the production structure (The Ricardo Effect).</s><s xml:id="_2rHWHsZ">However, consumers increase their demand for present

causes accounting losses in the most roundabout stages from final consumption.</s><s xml:id="_haysJvM">It subsequently drives the rise in interest rates, even higher than before the credit expansion because 1) the premium for the expected loss of purchasing power and the risk of default increase; 2) entrepreneurs prefer to pay higher interest rather than lose what they have invested.</s><s

boom-and-bust cycles.</s><s xml:id="_5phdKm9">When the central bank raises the money supply to reduce the interest rate to stimulate aggregate demand, consumption and entrepreneurial plans will inevitably be inconsistent.</s><s xml:id="_tGJFMM6">However, the U.S. Federal Reserve's money stock measures, commonly used in economic and business forecasts, fail because they are not based on an explicit and coherent theoretical conception of the essence of money <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Salerno, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Shostak, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr"

process, the quantity of fiat money is always determined by the decisions of governments and central banks, regardless of the desires and actions of the money demanders.</s><s xml:id="_EQMZZEn">Money is routinely accepted as the final means of payment for all market participants, meaning that fiat money can be borrowed and spent in terms of monetary and credit inflation, regardless of demand.</s><s xml:id="_8wXQ58T">As <ref type="bibr">Shostak (2000, p. 69)</ref> states, "What determines whether money M1, M2, and the other Ms are valid definitions is how well they correlate with national income.</s><s xml:id="_u7GyBVf">Most economists hold that, since the early 1980s, correlations between various definitions of money and national income have broken down".</s><s

liquidity be accepted as money?</s></p><p xml:id="_ekvDHZF"><s xml:id="_wGChEtu">The existing money supply measures need a better understanding of the cause of business cycles.</s><s xml:id="_HuRcUGQ">The concept of TMS was pioneered by the ABCT scholars Murray <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rothbard (1983)</ref> and Joseph <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Salerno (1987)</ref> to represent the amount of money in the economy available for immediate use in exchange.</s><s xml:id="_ZvC6r3U">The TMS is an imperfect attempt to provide a statistical measure of money consistent with the theoretical definition of money as the general means of exchange in society.</s><s xml:id="_xeUyjNN">According to Rothbard and Salerno's approach, the familiar sets of Ms (M1, M2 and M3) calculated by central banks exclude some items identifiable as money and others lacking the essential property of a general medium of exchange.</s><s xml:id="_rUQHx23">As a general medium of exchange, money is a universal commodity and is routinely accepted in exchanges in the market process.</s><s xml:id="_DZ8bvmF">In other words, money is the final payment method in all transactions.</s></p><p

narrow conventional measures like Ms. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">6</ref>First, the TMS includes some components of M1, such as fiat money held by the nonbank public, except for money held by the U.S. treasury and in the commercial values of the banks.</s><s xml:id="_px8HKbC">Demand deposits or checking account balances at commercial banks are also included in TMS because the depositor or a third party designated by the depositor can claim the physical or cash standard.</s><s xml:id="_sNB2dXf">Traveler's checks issued by non-bank financial institutions, such as American Express or

completed.</s></p><p xml:id="_BFTV5zY"><s xml:id="_JTMCXHz">Second, TMS includes some components of M2 not included in M1.</s><s xml:id="_MKDNu2b">Savings deposits are included in the TMS because they are part of sight deposits; that is, they are effectively withdrawable on demand by depositors in cash.</s><s xml:id="_KBhUFVx">The money market deposit accounts are considered part of the TMS, offering par value capability upon demand from depositors.</s><s xml:id="_zHybBUK">In contrast, Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMF) and Small-denomination time deposits are not cashable on demand, so they are excluded from TMS.</s></p><p xml:id="_9NuCNvZ"><s xml:id="_MSX5D4r">Third, TMS excludes components of M3 not included in M2.</s><s xml:id="_CVrUpG2">Large-denomination time deposits are excluded from TMS because they are not payable by the issuing institution before maturity.</s><s xml:id="_yY8ewwX">In the case of components of L not included in M3, the U.S. Savings Bonuses are included in TMS because they are instantly cashable in the U.S. Treasury or associated institutions in their redemption value.</s><s xml:id="_wQwXPTT">In contrast, short-term Treasury securities are
