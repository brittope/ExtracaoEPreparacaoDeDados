1970s, after a quarter of a century of bureaucratically determined exchange rates, the world appeared to leap into a regime of market-determined exchange rates.</s><s xml:id="_D4mbqrP">In the previous decade, those who administered and policed the Bretton Woods international monetary system considered a variety of reforms but 'firmly and unanimously discarded at the very outset' the two reforms that were subsequently implemented: flexible exchange rates and flexible gold prices <ref type="bibr">(Triffin 1968, 105;</ref><ref type="bibr">1976, 49)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N7vrQaU">The role played by academic economists in this international revolution has usually been relegated to minor proportions or ignored altogether.</s><s xml:id="_D2euC3Q">Yet, what appeared to be a sudden policy leap had been preceded by years of academic campaigning -a campaign that is documented and analysed in this study.</s><s xml:id="_BpSUVJb">John Maynard Keynes shared with Karl Marx the belief that capitalism was inherently unstable.</s><s xml:id="_9SwwTAy"><ref type="bibr">Keynes's (1936, 383)</ref> hope for a 'middle way' solution to the instability of the 1930s rested on the belief that the 'power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas'.</s><s xml:id="_pgKXhej">In Milton <ref type="bibr">Friedman's (1967, 76)</ref> judgement, the debate over flexible exchange rates pitted private sector bankers with 'unlimited faith in the ability of government bureaucrats' against academics with faith in private market outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_TggqHBJ">This study documents the process by which the idea of allowing the price of foreign exchange to be determined largely by market forces rather than forces supervised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gradually encroached on the policy-making process.</s><s xml:id="_CQ2jUra">This free market idea was opposed by those who had a vested interest in the preservation of the writ of the IMF edict and who were haunted by the 'specter' of institutional impotence <ref type="bibr">(Southard 1979, 45)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mTxXmqs">This vested interest intermingled with the understandable fear that floating exchange rates would unleash all the furies of the 1930s.</s></p><p xml:id="_tyXBdBQ"><s xml:id="_3gfCaJm">Paul Volcker described aspects of the 'intellectual and institutional base' for the Bretton Woods international order <ref type="bibr">(Volcker and Gyohten 1992, 3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xC83eus">The advocates of floating exchange rates assaulted first the intellectual base and then the institutional base: a classic example of the gradual encroachment of ideas.</s><s xml:id="_S3Vz9Re">But in 1968, Friedman presented the case so as to appeal to President-elect Richard Nixon's vested interest in being a two-term President.</s><s xml:id="_K8Dnxvx">What <ref type="bibr">Nixon (1980, 245)</ref> described as Friedman's 'escape' route began to appeal to those who were averse to the crises that appeared to be endemic to the Bretton Woods system.</s><s xml:id="_7hTEwf3">Simultaneously, Friedman's case for monetary targeting appealed to those who were grappling with the apparently intractable problems of restraining price and wage inflation and the associated industrial disputation.</s></p><p xml:id="_kHccwwB"><s xml:id="_qNgys3b">After the Bretton Woods system collapsed, <ref type="bibr">Friedman (1988a)</ref> wrote the introduction to an anthology for the American Coalition for Flexible Exchange Rates, which had been formed to prevent a return to exchange rate fixity <ref type="bibr">(Melamed 1988a, xvi)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WPhxvJz">Earlier, before the collapse of the par value system, academic economists behaved 'as if' they were members of a coordinated coalition pressing for flexible exchange rates.</s><s xml:id="_wsuEw22">This study documents the process by which Friedman's case converted academic economists into what amounted to an organised pressure group (the first phase) and then permeated (marginally) into the international monetary bureaucracy (the second phase) and then penetrated (forcefully) into Nixon's White House (the third phase).</s><s xml:id="_4Ade6fP">The fourth phase, the establishment of a futures market in foreign exchange, was undertaken by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the Bretton Woods system was collapsing.</s><s xml:id="_hr3caDq">The first and second processes were 'organised' by Fritz Machlup; the third stage was facilitated by US Treasury Secretaries David Kennedy, John Connally, George Shultz, William Simon and their deputies (including Paul Volcker) and to a lesser extent by Gottfried Haberler, Consultant to the US Treasury and chairman of President-elect Nixon's Task Force on the Balance of Payments.</s></p><p xml:id="_V947QMp"><s xml:id="_p8vVCx5">Friedman played an important role in all four stages.</s></p><p xml:id="_JEQUgxh"><s xml:id="_kKevTTT">This study therefore examines the interactions between three groups of agents in the international economic arena: academic economists, the Bretton Woods administrators and US policy makers.</s><s xml:id="_GWBDdr3">Part I examines the intellectual background: the combatants (Chapter 2), the relationship between fixed exchange rates and the two goals of full employment and free trade (Chapter 3), Friedman's case for flexible exchange rates (Chapter 4) and the characteristics of those who were determined to maintain the par value system (Chapter 5).</s></p><p xml:id="_fuQfysn"><s xml:id="_kCK3JXk">Part II describes the academic and intellectual process from the 1940s to the late 1960s, when Friedman was President of the American Economic Association (AEA) and Nixon was President of the United States: the early history of Friedman's case (Chapter 6), the emerging academic consensus (Chapter 7), four 1966 academic conferences (Chapter 8) and Friedman's 1967 debate with Robert Roosa, the President of the American Finance Association (Chapter 9).</s></p><p xml:id="_4u9chjB"><s xml:id="_tydSanP">Part III describes the policy process from Nixon's 1968 election victory to the August 1971 New Economic Policy (NEP) which introduced wage and price control and allowed the dollar to float.</s><s xml:id="_nACzPS8">Both were designed to be temporary, although the par value system did not remain patched up for long.</s><s xml:id="_9PuHqGM">Chapter 10 describes the process by which the case for flexible exchange rates became influential in Washington.</s><s xml:id="_tPbvdHQ">Chapter 11 outlines Friedman's attempt to persuade Nixon that flexible exchange rates were an ideal vehicle for his re-election.</s></p><p xml:id="_8F8vZnN"><s xml:id="_KESrCKh">From victory in Europe to defeat in Vietnam, Americans had been spared the choice of being for or against Nixon in only two national elections <ref type="bibr">(1948 and 1964)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UK4cAW7">When Connally wanted to 'hit Nixon right where he lived' he taunted him with the prospect of being the one-term Herbert Hoover of his time <ref type="bibr">(Rather and Gates 1974, 279)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_khgp9r6">Between <ref type="bibr">Hoover's Presidency (1929-33)</ref> and the policy hegemony of the Hoover Institution economists , Roosevelt was the perennial President and then Nixon was the perennial candidate.</s></p><p xml:id="_nuvC6hP"><s xml:id="_PSYvAy6">Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected US President not once but four times.</s><s xml:id="_tqEXzs2">At the start of his first term, Roosevelt suspended the internal convertibility of the dollar into gold (the nationalisation of gold).</s><s xml:id="_AQVxmDD">In August 1971, Nixon suspended the external convertibility of the dollar into gold (the demonetisation of gold).</s><s xml:id="_jpZXKXR">Chapter 12 describes Friedman's attempt to persuade Nixon to disburden himself of the 'cross of gold'.</s><s xml:id="_Df3sC33">Chapter 13 describes the path towards the price and wage controls that were experimented with on both sides of the Atlantic in the early 1970s, experiments which coincided with the decontrol of exchange rates.</s></p><p xml:id="_49xzAfx"><s xml:id="_EhJWpxz">Part IV illustrates Friedman's interaction with the international monetary system.</s><s xml:id="_djxJGqn">Chapter 14 discusses the nature of Friedman's influence.</s><s xml:id="_u7eEuFZ">Some comparisons are drawn between Keynes and Friedman, and some of the associations formed at the University of Chicago are examined.</s><s xml:id="_WnjQdan">Friedman's loyalty to the Chicago cause is examined, as is the loyalty of the Bretton Woods administrator to the system of fixed exchange rates.</s></p><p xml:id="_WVNswPj"><s xml:id="_UWrMQBB">The following six chapters (15-20) examine previously unreported correspondence to dissect Friedman's relationships with 16 (mostly highly important) players in debates about the international economy: five intellectuals, Lionel Robbins, Enoch Powell, John Kenneth Galbraith, Paul Samuelson and Charles Kindleberger, two US Senators, Paul Douglas and Barry Goldwater, the international policemen and especially Per Jacobsson of the IMF, the four US Treasury Secretaries of the era, David Kennedy, John Connally, George Shultz and William Simon, the two Federal Reserve Chairmen of the era, William McChesney Martin and Arthur Burns, plus a White House adviser, Pierre Rinfret, and Nixon.</s><s xml:id="_fXGKkUk">Of the intellectuals Robbins was a senior libertarian, Powell an aspiring British Prime Minister, Galbraith a leading Left Keynesian, Samuelson a leading Right Keynesian and Kindleberger a leading international economist and textbook writer.</s><s xml:id="_yAJmQdw">Rinfret competed with Friedman for Nixon's ear.</s></p><p xml:id="_hVpFRpM"><s xml:id="_RpArK4H">As the international monetary policemen struggled to patch up the fixed exchange rate system and began to consider placing more elastic bands around the par values, Nixon was consumed by Watergate and foreign policy (especially relations with China and the Soviet Union and the wars in Vietnam and the Middle East).</s><s xml:id="_yKuvMGN">His Treasury advisers wished to bury Bretton Woods: in international negotiations they offered 'faint praise' for a revised par value system while guaranteeing their right to let the dollar float.</s><s xml:id="_RjgVf3n">The system had been under strain throughout the 1960s, but the advice that Nixon received from his Task Force on the Balance of Payments and from his Treasury Secretaries differed from the advice that Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower had been offered.</s><s xml:id="_ayEQe9Z">The crucial US participants in the efforts to patch up the system were motivated by a different perspective about the desirable end-state than were their predecessors.</s></p><p xml:id="_yZAh6T2"><s xml:id="_g5szVDT">Part V describes continues the narrative until the 1975-76 revision of the IMF Articles of Agreement which legitimised floating.</s><s xml:id="_Z34HpHa">Although the system of fixed exchange rates collapsed for a variety of reasons, efforts to revive the system were abandoned in large part because of the attitudes of those within the Nixon-Ford Treasury Departments.</s><s xml:id="_pxaudyP">The success of their (and Friedman's) advocacy of a floating system was conditional on the attitude of 'benign neglect' that they encouraged Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford to adopt.</s><s xml:id="_fMF24Ve">Chapters 21 and 22 analyse the final collapse of the par value system, during Shultz's and Simon's tenure as Treasury Secretaries.</s><s xml:id="_nh57Ts6">Concluding comments are provided in Chapter 23.</s></p></div>

institutional battles between the IMF and the influence of Milton Friedman.</s><s xml:id="_Dpmv42M">It focuses on the process by which the defenders of a par value system were confronted by an academic heretic who, having nailed his theses (first in Germany, just as a predecessor had done four and quarter centuries before) tenaciously pursued his heresy.</s><s xml:id="_kNE5scC">Friedman's intellectual rebellion against 'papal' authority invoked the right of national economic sovereignty, and after almost '30 years' of intellectual and political schism, the 1976 'Treaty' of Jamaica resembled the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia in terms of the toleration offered to heretical floaters.</s></p><p xml:id="_bVVwqfq"><s xml:id="_MQ8Rxnj">The IMF sat at the centre of the monetary universe until it was replaced by market forces in what the German central banker Otmar <ref type="bibr">Emminger (1976, 13)</ref> described as 'a sort of "Copernican revolution"'.</s><s xml:id="_AhR2m6e">This international revolution facilitated the domestic monetarist counter-revolution -although Friedman was not impressed by the continued attempts to influence the value of the dollar <ref type="bibr">(Friedman and Friedman 1980, 70)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_22yPV85">However, no account of the fall of the Bretton Woods system would be complete without an attempt to discuss the role of the IMF and the consequences of their 'undeviating' devotion to the par value system <ref type="bibr">(Southard 1979, 23;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Vries 1985a, 105)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bmgtmj7"><s xml:id="_7JmG4uu">Contemporary history frequently generates considerable polemical heat, and few institutions have been as controversial as the IMF and the Chicago School of Economics.</s><s xml:id="_JFnF3AF">For example, mainstream economists, such as Rudiger <ref type="bibr">Dornbusch (1993, 103)</ref> declared that 'When it counts, the IMF can be relied upon to be disappointing.'</s><s xml:id="_NCYHPRg">Others have been even more uncompromising.</s><s xml:id="_SeKWm7r">The Case against the IMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">(McQuillan 2000)</ref> has been marshalled at the Hoover Institution (ideologically, a Chicago outpost).</s><s xml:id="_XDH2XSe">In Who Needs the <ref type="bibr">IMF Shultz, Simon and James Wriston (1998)</ref> argued that the IMF was 'ineffective, unnecessary, and obsolete'.</s><s xml:id="_9BbkEAZ">In his prestigious AEA Ely Lecture, <ref type="bibr">Shultz (1995, 5)</ref> recommended that the IMF be abolished and a 'drastically' pruned institution be established by merging the IMF and the World Bank.</s><s xml:id="_TyHgUn6">Indeed, before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Shultz gave the IMF an 'F': it was time 'to close the book on the IMF' <ref type="bibr">(Hoover Digest 2000, no. 3)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_E5wfYRj"><s xml:id="_uCxPrfs">Part of Shultz's reasoning was based on competence:</s></p><p xml:id="_YeTunkM"><s xml:id="_EbdMMff">The evidence is that the IMF's economic programs have often been wrong, so their competence in economics, their presumed area of expertise, must be questioned.</s><s xml:id="_yZC5XHC">But when they get into the business of prescribing policies that infringe on the politics of countries, they really don't know what they're doing.</s></p><p xml:id="_cmUdcCh"><s xml:id="_SUxbTUN">This type of reasoning inevitably produces a defensive response from IMF economists, at least one of whom has detected in this volume a similar attempt to denigrate his institution.</s><s xml:id="_nR26ka4">Therefore it should be made clear at the outset that this essay is part of no such preconceived agenda.</s><s xml:id="_hd6nScE">Instead, it is an attempt to supplement the existing material by examining the intellectual and institutional campaign against the par value system.</s><s xml:id="_cuxdDtc">The collapse of the patched up Bretton Woods system has usually been attributed to the failure to transcend national self-interest or, more often, to the insurmountable problems associated with maintaining exchange rate fixity after the oil price shocks of the 1970s.</s><s xml:id="_VHSZ2xE">One historian asked why the outcome (the legitimisation of flexible exchange rates) differed 'so totally' from the original intentions of those who sought to save the system <ref type="bibr">(Williamson 1987, 18)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Vv2DdPz">Events may have moved too fast to save the system <ref type="bibr">(de Vries 1987, 96)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x9xc8nn">But the world had also been turned intellectually upside down by the revolutionary advocacy of flexible exchange rates.</s><s xml:id="_pwzN4GV">Friedman's major co-author offered a four-word paragraph by way of explanation: 'Market forces had triumphed' <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz 1987, 350)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3eAqejB">There was also, however, an intellectual and institutional triumph for those who advocated the ascendancy of market forces.</s></p><p xml:id="_f9skPFN"><s xml:id="_xdQtFUd">Certainly, the final outcome may well have been different had Nixon and Ford and their Treasury Secretaries been committed to a par value system.</s><s xml:id="_UBAsNRY">This has previously been acknowledged, as has the importance of 'key personalities' pressing for flexible exchange rates <ref type="bibr">(Scammell 1983, 184;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williamson 1987, 19)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fu82Qem">But the intellectual and institutional dimensions of this policy volte-face have usually not been brought to the forefront.</s><s xml:id="_ecpwyne"><ref type="bibr">Friedman (1968a, 186)</ref> reflected about the 'extraordinary importance of accidents of personality' with respect to monetary outcomes; and both Shultz and Simon and their deputies were firm advocates of exchange rate flexibility.</s><s xml:id="_9w6QGyF">Nixon, under their influence, was also not inclined to defend the patched up Bretton Woods system.</s><s xml:id="_SPDFnC3">It is impossible to quantify these direct and indirect intellectual influences, but it is reasonable to conclude that such influences were highly significant and therefore worthy of detailed scrutiny.</s></p><p xml:id="_aZFta5S"><s xml:id="_tFN4FcV">IMF officials were apparently psychologically ill-prepared for the assault on the par value system.</s><s xml:id="_b9TkNYU">Their institution had been established to prevent a return to the dislocation of the 1930s.</s><s xml:id="_NJtSTZS">Until the 1960s, it was widely accepted both by academic and IMF economists that floating exchange rates were a species of law-breaking behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_xwmrnD5">For understandable reasons, this assumption became central to IMF thinking; their defence of civilisation became synonymous with their defence of the IMF.</s><s xml:id="_R6F3hVk">In a static or slowly changing world, collective institutional assumptions, like a common language, can reduce short-run communication costs.</s><s xml:id="_bRES4vy">It is more costly to communicate with 'outsiders' who share neither language nor common assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_q8yEZ4c">It appears that those who policed the Bretton Woods system regarded the benefits of communication with heretical 'outsiders' as usually being dwarfed by the costs.</s></p><p xml:id="_qMjWqMp"><s xml:id="_mXkfWm5">Until the 1960s, the assumptions of the IMF held monopoly sway both at an intellectual and at an institutional level.</s><s xml:id="_kWZFkwG">But the Chicago counter-revolution was a coordinated and well-thought-out assault on orthodoxy.</s><s xml:id="_C8F27gK">As international trading relations began to atrophy in the 1930s, Chicago graduate students were exposed to Jacob Viner's Economics 301, which produced what Friedman described as a 'revelation, a perspective that showed economic theory as a coherent and logical whole'. 1 The second-generation Chicago economists -especially George Stigler -constructed a theory of the sociology of knowledge which viewed the market for economics as a coherent and logical whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(Leeson 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_KwaHG74"><s xml:id="_Ru6Hrnk">The par value system was destroyed both by market forces and by the weakened resolve to interfere with those market forces. 2</s><s xml:id="_qD6HdrW">Friedman (and his associates) played the major role in the weakening of this resolve: he occupied, according to Stigler, the 'de facto presidency of the unorganised Friends of Private Enterprise'. 3</s><s xml:id="_5V3gk87">In The Intellectual and the Market Place, <ref type="bibr">Stigler (1963, 42)</ref> noted that knowledge is produced under competitive conditions: 'confused' participants would 'watch their customers vanish, their best employees migrate, their assets dissipate'.</s><s xml:id="_6SSwZcc">Moreover, a monopolist was 'overwhelmingly dominated by forces over which he had negligible control.</s><s xml:id="_BchRwnS">This paradox that power deprives one of the certainty of success is partly verbal, as all good paradoxes are, but it contains an important truth.</s><s xml:id="_qkXyu4B"><ref type="bibr">'</ref> In A Time for Truth, William <ref type="bibr">Simon (1978, 198)</ref> cited approvingly Friedman's view of monopoly: 'The major source of private monopoly has not been private collusion, it has been government activity.</s><s xml:id="_8w2pVmR">There is hardly a major monopoly in the United States that doesn't derive its power from government grants.'</s><s xml:id="_bR6ubcC">In the 1930s, the world had suffered from a lack of international leadership; the IMF had been established as a vehicle through which such leadership could be exercised.</s><s xml:id="_QdzhG2B">Institutionally, their monopoly power was limited only by intransigent national governments that sometimes resorted to currency floats, thus undermining the leadership of the IMF.</s><s xml:id="_MjCdBac">In the 1960s, the IMF might legitimately have regarded their 'firm' as virtually the entire institutional 'industry'.</s><s xml:id="_rC7mat7">However, they appeared not to fully appreciate the extent to which their institutional monopoly was conditional upon the support of the US Treasury.</s></p><p xml:id="_RnawFyj"><s xml:id="_zyNTfxZ">Friedman's academic opponents became obsessed with his work: 'he controlled the Cambridge Universities and Yale.</s><s xml:id="_TgaDbX2">They were devoting much of their efforts to seeking to refute what he had most recently written' <ref type="bibr">(Stigler 1988, 33-4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gURUe99">In contrast, the IMF was accustomed to

I’m eating for two, if indeed I’ve incorporated him a la ‘Mourning and Melancholia’ (M, 69). I keep coming up against this network of references in your fiction: the loss of the father, the idea of mourning as a lump in the throat impeding communication, and above all a sense of resulting perplexity and confusion. It seems important that Paige’s harrowing recollection of her father in ‘To Find Words’ leads to her feeling ‘lost at sea and cast in doubt’ (MR, 25). It’s a question of narrative again… LT: Writing is always about loss in some way. Maybe for me my father’s loss became the loss that took in all loss, which made me want to write in the beginning. But there’s a way in which death is too easy, because death is everyone’s conclusion. Death is the closure that’s never closure. Because even if someone dies there are those alive who remember him or her. So the impact of that person’s life is still felt in the people living after. I’m thinking about the AIDS epidemic. There’s nothing conclusive about death except that it’s something we all do. That’s the curious thing about the paradox of using death—in a way I know that whenever I put death in my work it’s the most vital thing to do, because we all feel so connected to it. PN: In interviews you’ve often talked about Cast in Doubt in terms of a collision of modernist and postmodernist perspectives. Does the difference again have to do with conceptions of narrative? LT: I wanted to do many things in that book, including figuring out how to tell a story that reflected on story-telling and on how we read stories. PN: It does seem that Horace can only reach a sense of self by seeing himself as a character in a story. There’s a curious passage where he says ‘While I accept the Greek version of destiny, or fate, as in tragedy, when one’s end flows from one’s flaws, from hubris, I abhor the idea that one’s life is fated’ (C, 160). But the Greeks couldn’t dissociate those ideas, and are you suggesting that Horace ultimately can’t either (his novel is, after all, called Household Gods…)? LT: That is a strange passage. I think I wanted, because I was playing off the Greek material, the notion of an inevitability, certain things set in motion, from x to y to z. But as a modernist, Horace also wants to think about progress and about his own ability to insert himself in the story and make a change. There’s a certain kind of optimism in that, but it’s confused. He’s confused by two kinds of narrative, the narrative of inevitability and the narrative of change.</title>

		<title level="a" type="main" xml:id="_8k8RD7x">television, constrained at the time from such a move by Independent Broadcasting Association regulations (Willock 1992). Coronation Street and Crossroads had been stripped across three evenings, and EastEnders across two. Stripping across five days/nights had long been common in Australian television. This was first done for Number 96 (1972–1977) by Ian Holmes, later the Grundy Organisation’s president. So successful was the stripping of Neighbours across five days that the same principle has since been adopted in the UK for Home and Away. David Liddiment, Head of Entertainment at Granada, which produces Coronation Street and Families, both Neighbours competitors, went so far as to say: “In future, no-one will contemplate running a daytime serial in the UK except as a strip. It’s inevitable that you build success more quickly when you strip a soap” (Liddiment 1989: 20). Second, on scheduling, Loughton made the schedules more cost-effective by repeating each edition daily (Patterson 1992). “The time-slots chosen by the BBC were 1.30 pm, with a repeat the following morning at 9.05. It attracted a typical audience of housewives, shift workers, the unemployed, people home sick” (Oram 1988: 48). After the unexpected success of Neighbours’ first year, it was decided to reschedule the next morning repeat for the same evening, at 5:35 p.m. This was to cater for working mothers, but most of all for schoolchildren who had previously played truant to watch the series. The most famous story attributes the schedule change to the representations made to no less than Michael Grade himself by his daughter. Rescheduled in January 1988, Neighbours nearly doubled its audience to 16.25 million within six weeks. By Christmas 1988, audiences topped 20 million. Five-day stripping and repeat screenings, then, offered a regularity and familiarity significant in capturing such huge audiences, representing one-third of the UK population. The third precondition was the UK “mediascape.” This included a very broad familiarity with Australian soaps. When Neighbours was launched on October 27, 1986, The Sullivans, A Country Practice, Young Doctors, Flying Doctors, Richmond Hills, Prisoner: Cell Block H, and others had broadened the paths already beaten by many Australian films released in the UK. Michael Collins, executive in charge of production at JNP, producers of A Country Practice, maintains that the serial, screened in the UK since 1983, “was a forerunner in getting audiences used to Australian drama” (Collins 1991). And one factor contributing to Neighbours’s topping the ratings late in 1988 would have been the demise of Crossroads, the British soap created by Reg Watson, in spring 1988 after a twenty-four-year run. Fourth, tabloids, television, and un(der)employment. Under Thatcher and Murdoch, the tabloid press in Britain expanded in the mid-1980s, producing what one television executive described, albeit parodically, as “one page of news, one page of sex, and twenty-two pages of television and sport” (Patterson 1992). So when Neighbours was stripped over five days, “the papers really noticed it” (Willock 1992). Together with Woman, Woman’s Day, Jackie, Scoop, and other teen magazines, the tabloids ran myriad stories on Kylie, Jason, Peter O’Brien, and so on, as is indicated by the three sample headlines from three successive days:</title>

[32] So which of you finds it credible that, when I had earlier made a voyage away from the city taking the boy with me, to avoid fighting with Simon, once I arrived back I took him to Simon’s house, where I was likely to have the most trouble? [33] And when scheming against him did I come so ill-prepared that I had summoned neither friends nor servants nor any other person, except for this child, who could not have helped me, but would be able to disclose under torture any offence I committed? [34] Was I so stupid that when scheming against Simon, instead of watching for an opportunity to catch him alone, at night or in daylight, I went to the very place where I was sure to be seen by the largest number of people and beaten up, as though my intent was against myself, to ensure that I received the maximum humiliation from my enemies? [35] Furthermore, Council, you can easily tell from the fight which took place that he is lying. Once the boy realized what was happening, he threw off his robe and took to flight, and these people followed him, while I went off by another route. [36] But who should one hold responsible for what happened, the ones who ran away or the ones who tried to catch them? I think it’s obvious to all that people who fear for their safety flee and people who wish to cause harm pursue. [37] And it’s not the case that though this is the probability what actually happened was different. They seized the lad on the street and were dragging him off by force; I came along, and I did not touch them but took hold of the boy, while they were dragging him off by force and beating me. This has been attested for you by those who were present. So it is intolerable if it is to be believed that I am guilty of intent in matters where these people have in reality behaved in such an appalling and lawless way. [38] Whatever would have happened to me, if the reverse of this had happened, if accompanied by many of my friends I had met Simon, fought with him and beaten him, then pursued him and having caught him I tried to drag him off by force, if as it is when he has behaved like this I find myself facing a trial of such seriousness, in which I stand to lose my fatherland and all my possessions? [39] The most important and clearest indication is this. The man who has been wronged and schemed against by me, as he claims, could not bring himself to bring a charge before you for four years. Other people, when they are in love and are robbed of the object of desire and are beaten up, grow angry and attempt to take revenge at once, while this man does it ages afterwards.</title>
