prevented a worse scenario than if there had been no interventions at all.</s><s xml:id="_f34FUQd">State restrictions and federal spending programs have undoubtedly benefited many people, but when considering the full range of tradeoffs and unintended consequences, such policies may have created more harm than good in some instances.</s><s xml:id="_wyA4uAY">For example, the increase in the unemployment benefits changed the incentive structure of workers who were laid off.</s><s xml:id="_PPr59YP">Some people earned more money from the unemployment benefits than they previously earned at their job, causing a disincentive to return to work at the margin when it was deemed safe to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ganong et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Holzer et al.

policymakers should consider the wide variety of seen and unseen costs of policies that are likely to have many negative unintended consequences.</s><s xml:id="_NU4uMZA">Highlighting the perils of regulation does not mean that policymakers cannot or should not create public policies during a pandemic; however, Kirzner's insights illuminate the costs of public policies so that policymakers can

regulating COVID-19.</s></p><p xml:id="_qf8AmU3"><s xml:id="_Q2tTc8X">Further, particular governance systems, such as polycentricity, may be better suited to adapt to the changing circumstances of an ongoing, global pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_cavUsqt">Polycentric governance structures may be especially helpful when considering the stifled and superfluous discovery processes that were sparked by the various COVID-19 policies.</s><s xml:id="_hg5d6Jd">Since polycentric systems have multiple decision-making centers, policy-makers can experiment with different policies in various jurisdictions.</s><s xml:id="_pj7UESm">Through this "laboratory of democracy," policymakers can mutually learn from the successes and failures of their counterparts in other jurisdictions as well as tailor policies based on their unique circumstances.</s><s xml:id="_SGjVgy8">Additionally, an institutional failure in one jurisdiction is limited in how much it can spillover onto other jurisdictions and lessons from more successful jurisdictions may be utilized to correct course <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ostrom 1976)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2uuhWjM">Due to the diversity of stay-at-home orders and essentialness designations among the various states, not all places in the United States experienced the same types of stifled and superfluous entrepreneurial discoveries.</s><s xml:id="_SQKCwen">However, federal

exchange.</s><s xml:id="_Ft6zEAC">Through the market process, entrepreneurs have both the incentives and the feedback to determine which goods consumers need, how urgent those needs are, which

undermine the intended goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Coyne et al. 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t2Y8D9M">For example, the spread of COVID-19 triggered governments around the globe to institute restrictions on businesses, travel, and social gathering and encouraged (and sometimes forced) residents to remain at home to slow the spread of the disease and not overburden the healthcare system.</s><s xml:id="_abEFMrc">The longer these practices remained in place (both formally and informally through changes in consumer behavior), the more necessary it became to offer stimulus checks

services.</s><s xml:id="_Y8UDd44">In this sense, each policy is partially caused by the ones proceeding it, and each incurs costs as well as providing relief.</s></p><p xml:id="_948ANxu"><s

2020, deeming them non-essential (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Redford and Dills 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sexton et al. 2020</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_tyS2hpG">However, when long lines formed outside of the stores just hours after the announcement, the decision was reversed due to public health concerns regarding exposure risk (ibid.).</s><s xml:id="_ETp3tGt">In an attempt to limit activity, policymakers actually instituted policies that could increase the spread of COVID-19 rather than reduce it.</s><s xml:id="_DSEM49f">Second, in the summer of 2020, the federal government declared that any international students enrolled in online courses for the fall would be required to return to their home countries (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Griswold and Salmon 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Storr et al. 2022)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MtPe4EJ">Universities across the country filed lawsuits and the decision was quickly reversed.</s><s xml:id="_N78rPnb">In the short time it was in place, students, universities, and communities realized the uncertainty and compliance issues with enforcing the rule as well as the economic and social impacts of forcing over one million international students to leave the country (ibid.).</s></p><p xml:id="_9ZUcB26"><s xml:id="_4VQxhru">Not all types of entrepreneurship are socially productive, and some forms of entrepreneurship are socially unproductive or even destructive.</s><s xml:id="_XHp66yW">Productive entrepreneurship yields a net increase in wealth in a society, whereas unproductive

target="#b43">March et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_huq7dTU">In other words, productive entrepreneurship is a positive-sum game, unproductive entrepreneurship is a zero-sum game, and destructive entrepreneurship is a negative-sum game.</s><s xml:id="_TufxHNw">The formal and informal incentives and constraints that entrepreneurs face will shape how productive, unproductive, or destructive entrepreneurship will be.</s></p><p xml:id="_24yXuHz"><s xml:id="_7dCg5SK">In societies that have relatively free markets, well-protected property rights, and the rule of law, market entrepreneurship will generally lead to socially productive outcomes as they discover the needs and wants of consumers and compete among themselves to best provide consumers with goods and services.</s><s xml:id="_cP35xNz">Legal structures and public policies are important sources of incentives and constraints for entrepreneurs.</s><s xml:id="_65vTDwa">Despite the intentions motivating public policies, the incentives created by those policies direct market entrepreneurs to be alert to and discover different opportunities that would not have existed if the policy had not been created.</s><s xml:id="_sz45QyP">Policies can encourage productive entrepreneurship if the altered incentives counter market failures or lead to socially beneficial outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_x5w8HQZ">Political rent-seeking, however, is unproductive and can become destructive when competition is restricted.</s><s xml:id="_PysVRTc">When rules and institutions change, the relative payoffs of different activities will also change, leading entrepreneurs to direct their attention and action in different ways.</s><s xml:id="_eHHqaYW"><ref type="bibr">Kirzner's (1985)</ref> "perils of regulation" argument articulates how unintended consequences of policies can arise due to entrepreneurs rationally responding to the incentives and constraints that the policies create, which can then spur further interventions.</s><s xml:id="_PVBkmjf">Kirzner outlines four types of discovery processes that emerge from government interventions into the market process: regulators may try to correct perceived inefficiencies or failures in the market that entrepreneurs have not previously identified or corrected (undiscovered), regulators attempt to simulate market outcomes but fall short (unsimulated), regulators end up restricting entrepreneurship (stifling), and regulators incentivize alternative, less socially useful entrepreneurial activity (superfluous).</s></p><p xml:id="_9FQpW3C"><s xml:id="_2w4C5Ry">The stifling of the entrepreneurial discovery processes of the market is problematic because discoveries that would have satisfied the needs and wants of consumers remain undiscovered.</s><s xml:id="_Xxw9VUF">Additionally, it is impossible to know the costs of the innovations that went undiscovered because we cannot know what would have happened if a policy was never put into place.</s><s xml:id="_7ac2Xm4">Despite this limitation, we can imagine the types of discoveries that would have been made if public policies had not stifled the discovery process.</s><s xml:id="_EK4EzhS">For example, when public policies raise compliance costs, large firms are better equipped to handle those costs, and smaller firms are squeezed out of the market.</s><s xml:id="_sVE3h7c">New entrepreneurial discoveries may arise from smaller or newer firms.</s><s xml:id="_yBTrUZj">As such, smaller firms lose out on potential profit, and consumers lose out on innovations that could have occurred if the smaller firms were able to test out their ideas.</s></p><p xml:id="_tP8ddWG"><s xml:id="_5BCmuwU">Kirzner acknowledges that government regulations may be beneficial in many ways, but just because a public policy has benefits, that does not mean that there are not also costs.</s><s xml:id="_C7yHJFp">To know whether a public policy is socially desirable, the marginal social benefits should equal the marginal social cost.</s><s xml:id="_dS4drg9">If regulations stifle the entrepreneurial discovery processes, the marginal costs of that stifling might outweigh the marginal benefits that come to a society from a particular regulation.</s><s xml:id="_e4uGDkk">As <ref type="bibr">Kirzner (1985, 143-144)</ref> argues, Price and quality restraints and requirements and restriction on organizational forms operate (in a generally understood but not precisely predictable way) to inhibit entrepreneurial discovery.</s><s xml:id="_uuWBJT4">Price ceilings, for example, not only restrict supply from known sources of natural gas (or from known prospects for search), but also inhibit the discovery of wholly unknown sources.</s><s xml:id="_GPmXGqK">Drug testing regulations, as another example, not only reduce the flow of new pharmaceutical drugs where successful research might have been more or less predictable, but also discourage the entrepreneurial discovery of wholly unknown research procedures.</s><s xml:id="_Xc78U7D">Against whatever benefits might be derived from government regulation and intervention, one is forced to weigh, as one of regulation's intrinsically immeasurable costs, the stifling of the market discovery process.</s></p><p xml:id="_zXKrjcA"><s xml:id="_B6QXUaS">Politicians often gain support by enacting policies that favor certain industries, companies, or individuals at the expense of taxpayers.</s><s xml:id="_UKuEyjE">Policymakers have the power of the state to compel others to obey government policies, which may be normatively 1 3 desirable in some cases and detrimental in others.</s><s xml:id="_hWax8K4">The coercive nature of the state allows policymakers to concentrate benefits for special interest groups, while dispersing the costs among everyone else.</s><s xml:id="_cfgEaVM">Thus, political actors can and do design policies in ways that benefit special interests instead of the public interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Holcombe 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2akUsfK">Public policies can create new, superfluous opportunities for entrepreneurial discovery, and many entrepreneurs take advantage of those opportunities.</s><s xml:id="_SFs67xg">For example, entrepreneurs may engage in lobbying and rent seeking to persuade politicians to provide subsidies or protections from competition.</s><s xml:id="_sfKVKMY">However, the policy-dependent opportunities may not be positive-sum like those in an unhampered market.</s><s xml:id="_RaWEsKf">In fact, many of these opportunities exhibit socially harmful tendencies, such as restricted market competition, rent seeking, lobbying, bribery, and other forms of corruption.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bt5Xdm2"><s xml:id="_dkWe3GH">Additionally, once a public policy is enacted, superfluous discovery arises in the market process in response to that policy, regardless of any nefarious or benevolent intentions behind it.</s><s xml:id="_TWmKBJk">Entrepreneurs will be alert to and discover new goods and services that correspond directly to the public policies, and those goods and services would not have been discovered if the policy had never been enacted.</s><s xml:id="_HB3hcTe">For example, COVID policies might alter health and safety requirements for business owners who might not have the time or expertise to keep up on the latest requirements.</s><s xml:id="_95csuWg">Individuals who are familiar with those requirements might act entrepreneurially by selling their knowledge-based services to business owners.</s><s xml:id="_Hrgg9zF">Thus, selling services to help others comply with regulations is a form of superfluous discovery that came about due specifically to the existence of
