xml:id="_3HbN5wc">However, the use of thought experiments in investigations of domains as diverse as subatomic entities, consumer behavior, viral spread, personal identity, and moral responsibility seems to indicate otherwise.</s><s xml:id="_jDz4nH9">In the lively debate on "how can we learn about reality <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> just by thinking?"</s><s xml:id="_f6ZNpKj"><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown and Fehige 2017)</ref>, two seemingly extreme positions regarding thought experiments are in evidence: James Robert Brown's Platonism, according to which some thought experiments provide intuition of universals, and John Norton's empiricist stance sustaining that thought experiments are simply picturesque forms of arguments or, at least, that they are rationally reconstructible as such. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The debate developed as attempts to find a middle ground between the two extremes were devised.</s><s xml:id="_G2cMM4s">A perspective that acquired relevance in this context is the view that thought experiments are operations with mental models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Miščević 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nersessian 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HqGu2ar">At the same time, attention partially shifted towards the question of what can be reliably asserted in counterfactual scenarios (see

learn about reality just by imagining remains, as well as Brown's and Norton's outposts in the search for an account of how knowledge or understanding of the world can be obtained from an investigation in which no new empirical information has been introduced.</s><s xml:id="_ztDkdUe">This paper invokes Otto Neurath's scientific utopianism to understand how novelty arises in thought experiments.</s><s xml:id="_CA5nGD5">We maintain that Neurath's utopias can be understood as centerpieces of thought experiments.</s><s xml:id="_vjuG4gb">Indeed, not only Neurath's logical empiricist philosophy but expressly his economic theorizing was strongly influenced by a pioneer in the philosophy of thought experiments, Ernst Mach (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nemeth 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5k5NFSS">There are at least three disciplinary approaches to analyze the use of utopias as part of thought experiments.</s><s xml:id="_NcftHPs">The first is by considering utopias in (thought) experiments in political philosophy (see e.g.</s><s xml:id="_nPNN7fN"><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Miščević 2018</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_APRqpBp">The second is to consider that utopias are part of thought experiments because, as Catherine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Elgin (2014)</ref> shows, many works of fiction and art can be so considered.</s><s xml:id="_M6uCy2S">This would emphasize the literary character of utopias.</s><s xml:id="_bnrmscX">But utopias are not only pieces of political philosophy and of literature, as Neurath reminds us, so a third way is to conceive utopias as part of thought experiments in social science and technology.</s><s xml:id="_R8AySv5">Each of these three disciplinary approaches can be carried out in different ways, according to the conception one assumes in regard to thought experiments.</s><s xml:id="_vvbyKVy">One can, for instance, consider that utopias are fictional narratives and so they can be understood as parts of thought experiments conceived in the context of mental modeling.</s><s xml:id="_9fmzhRk">This approach can be employed to understand the use of utopias in social science and technology and so to account for the uses of fiction in scientific contexts.</s><s xml:id="_k2MJXEK">However, although interesting and fruitful, such an outlook does not exclude the possibility of rationally reconstructing utopian thought experiments as arguments, as Norton proposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brendel 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EPYdFJs">Whatever the merits of conceiving of thought experiments as fictional narratives are, this paper focuses on the approach which rationally reconstructs thought experiments as arguments.</s></p><p xml:id="_twsQGEf"><s xml:id="_khqz8vS">The next section presents Neurath's utopianism.</s><s xml:id="_fGW6PCu">Section 3 briefly presents the debate between Brown and Norton and refines Sören Häggqvist's model of thought experiments.</s></p><p xml:id="_uHhXWq3"><s xml:id="_fGfKU4y">By the application of our reformulation of Häggqvist's model to one utopian and one dystopian example we will obtain insights on utopianism and on the argument view of thought experiments.</s><s xml:id="_ZMfrumX">Finally, Sect. 4 provides a third example and a Neurathian answer to the question as to how we can learn about the world just by using our
