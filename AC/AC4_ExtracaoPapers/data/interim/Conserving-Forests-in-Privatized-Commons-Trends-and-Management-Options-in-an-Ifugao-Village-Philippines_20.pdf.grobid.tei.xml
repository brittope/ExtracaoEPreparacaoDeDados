(2010: 100)</ref> that the analysis of the drivers of landuse change must focus on changes in land values over time.</s><s xml:id="_PCHvAvR">Incidentally, this emphasis on changes in land values can be subsumed under an arguably broader value theory beyond price valuation as have been expounded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mises (1949)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X7cqM9G">He argued that because value is subjective analysis of various social phenomena, including here changes in landuse and property institutions, should start at the individual level as individuals purposively act to achieve their perceived valuable goals.</s><s xml:id="_C6eYadr">The drivers of the present landuse are identified starting with a description and analysis of what was 'traditional.'</s><s xml:id="_ewG5s4g">The term 'traditional', here refers loosely to that period when landuse and land ownership were relatively stable.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_vgRDcVu">Traditional Landuse and Land Property Rights</head><p xml:id="_P42wuWB"><s xml:id="_hyjvTRm">The traditional landuses in municipality of Tinoc are shifting cultivation of sweet potato, and rice terraces for which the province of Ifugao is famous.</s><s xml:id="_rTrbfzg">In the village of Eheb, the total area of rice terraces is smaller than that of most villages in Tinoc, mainly due to the low temperature, steep slopes and limited sunlight in cultivable areas near the river where irrigation water is sourced.</s><s xml:id="_VdQfDER">The maximum area traditionally planted with rice in the village is only about 12 ha or 1 % of the total area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_s64AeYP">Rice production in Eheb is further limited by the use of low-yielding traditional varieties.</s><s xml:id="_7ugwnbs">Thus, sweet potato has been the main staple food for most of the villagers.</s><s xml:id="_qzsBFZD">Compared to rice, this crop requires less labour, and can be grown in a wide range of environmental conditions, including on higher, colder and unterraced land.</s></p><p xml:id="_DFSApc6"><s xml:id="_bQ2QfGz">Rice terraces have traditionally been privately-owned land.</s><s xml:id="_Hd8WFrK">They were usually passed on to children or relatives through inheritance but could be sold or mortgaged by the owner like any other private property.</s><s xml:id="_a4Wu3ns">Sweet potato farms, on the other hand, had usufructuary ownership: the user had exclusive rights to the land while it was in use and could be cultivated, resided on or fenced (for free range pigs) by others only after an occupant had abandoned it.</s><s xml:id="_sVBn3RR">There were instances when the right to harvest at someone else's sweet potato farm was exchanged.</s><s xml:id="_zwjHg77">For instance, people who ran out of food for various reasons such as pest infestation could offer to exchange a chicken until they were able to start harvesting on their own farm.</s><s xml:id="_TsatAB3">For land planted with fruit crops, private ownership was recognized not on the land but on the trees.</s><s xml:id="_h2yRGJd">This was especially in the case of coffee which was initially planted in Tinoc mainly as a cash crop during the American colonial period (1899-1946), a long-term investment that was most likely encouraged by the resulting peace from the gradual cessation of headhunting and tribal animosities.</s><s xml:id="_7YQA855">The exclusive right to harvest the coffee trees was also traded as shown by a case wherein the owner of the land and the coffee trees were different persons, until the coffee trees ceased bearing beans.</s><s xml:id="_eeApNcq">On the other hand, abandoned sweet potato farms and all other 'unimproved' land including forests were common property.</s><s xml:id="_CvRfbzZ">The relative stability of the traditional landuses and land ownership institutions could be attributed to factors within and outside the community; their causal relationships may be clarified with a deeper understanding of Kalanguya society especially in relation to events outside their traditional territories (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_ZfVpFFk">Philippine national history).</s></p><p xml:id="_4cnnf93"><s xml:id="_2TwDQ59">In traditional Kalanguya society, the movement of people and goods was impeded by steep terrain, and animosity among settlements and ethnic groups primarily due to the practice of headhunting, as well as the isolation of the Cordillera region relative to the surrounding lowlands that were all under Spanish colonial rule.</s><s xml:id="_y4kdUU5">Despite their isolation, the Kalanguya exchanged some goods (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_DjV5PUW">animals, grain and other supplies) to the mining towns in the province of Benguet and imported various goods that they did not produce, including metal tools, clothes, bronze gongs and Chinese porcelain <ref type="bibr">(Lewis 1992a</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_gF4eA8a">These wares were privately owned and indicative of a person's wealth.</s><s xml:id="_QGVWGw4">However, the ultimate recognition of wealth was not on ownership and accumulation of valuables but rather on giving them away, through redistributive feasts called padit or keleng.</s><s xml:id="_KFvjG2m">Padit is done in graduated stages.</s><s xml:id="_cGWnDs6">The more resources a person shares with the community (i.e. more pigs butchered to feed the community), the higher the social status gained, which was further translated into special privileges such as greater influence over community decision-making.</s><s xml:id="_2Q36UD7">Pandit also increased community status as a means to appease the spirits of dead ancestors who were then believed to have power to influence one's fate.</s><s xml:id="_8dtvAuY">In Eheb, the wealthiest person (or family) in memory lavished at least 16 feasts in his lifetime, which would have required butchering at least 104 pigs, as well as allocating other animal species for other purposes.</s><s xml:id="_PF6QACr">Incidentally, this person owned more than 1 ha of rice fields, the largest owned by a family in the village.</s></p><p xml:id="_Wnwy3qT"><s xml:id="_c4DTu2E">The practice of wealth redistribution perpetuated the traditional landuses, and to some extent land ownership, because it prevented improvement in agricultural technology while keeping labour productivity low.</s><s xml:id="_Qa3XXQe">The redistributive feasts limited individual and societal accumulation of savings, which also constrained overall investment activity, especially in agriculture.</s><s xml:id="_KvPqBSA">The productivity of both land and labour remained stagnant, as did the material wealth in traditional Kalanguya society.</s><s xml:id="_R8QPuU3">Rice fields were privately owned and highly valued because building them required substantial labour.</s><s xml:id="_5x6AJqk">Usufruct ownership of sweet potato farms and fruit trees reflected the lower labour cost to establish them.</s><s xml:id="_nS3xEX4">Forests were accessible to anyone including Kalanguya from neighbouring villages, partly because more neighbours meant greater availability of labour which was traded through traditional labour exchanges.</s></p><p xml:id="_AXVMkrF"><s xml:id="_94cU7Yu">The perpetuation of traditional landuse and land ownership could also be attributed to the regular outmigration of the Kalanguya people.</s><s xml:id="_c7XKfe6">Aside from having to constantly move to plant sweet potatoes, they often needed to move pigs and chickens usually across rivers and in adjacent mountains as a means to avoid their valued animals becoming infected by epidemics.</s><s xml:id="_hHR4999">However, the more significant migrations of the Kalanguya people, were out of Tinoc, occurring before, during and after World War II, as referenced by oral history.</s><s xml:id="_k2HtmUu">Pre-war outmigration involved the permanent movement of people to the nearby provinces including Nueva Vizcaya and Benguet.</s><s xml:id="_YjBWmfQ">These were due in particular to constant enemy raids of villages for human heads (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_CbCYFPT">headhunting) and for other valuables, Spanish military expeditions, smallpox and cholera epidemics, and the opening of the Spanish trail traversing Ahin which then required the people to render forced labour <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_zXnTtwf">Migrations during World War II were more temporary albeit memorable because of the devastation and casualties.</s><s xml:id="_uHP5YqJ">Post-war out-migrations were generally
