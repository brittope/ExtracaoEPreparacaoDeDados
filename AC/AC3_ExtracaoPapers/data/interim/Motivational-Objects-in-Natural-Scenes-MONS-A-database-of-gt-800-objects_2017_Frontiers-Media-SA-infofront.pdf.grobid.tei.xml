<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gRqDkxP">INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_eryzB7q"><s xml:id="_jbEcZGf">When interacting with the world around us, a range of factors guide our behavior.</s><s xml:id="_VQFzVeV">In addition to internal states and drives, actions are also determined by the incentive properties of our environment.</s><s xml:id="_f78qVdZ">Through experience, many objects come to be associated with appetitive or aversive motivational properties that guide our interaction with these objects in daily life.</s><s xml:id="_tbg3xQP">In contrast, research on the effects of motivation on attention or memory commonly employs artificial stimuli for which motivational relevance is learned during the experiment.</s><s xml:id="_VxvrEzZ">Some studies use real objects or scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hickey et al., 2015)</ref>, but pre-existing motivational value is rarely considered.</s><s xml:id="_Xte3WH2">Previous databases of emotional and motivational value generally present decontextualized objects on a blank background, such as food <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blechert et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miccoli et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ugHwch9">Research on the neural and behavioral effects of appetitive and aversive motivation, such as investigations of its effects on attention, memory and choice, could therefore benefit from a comprehensive database of the motivational value assigned to everyday objects in more complex scenes.</s></p><p xml:id="_eURX2wY"><s xml:id="_PZQuEsN">Motivational stimuli and internal motivational states serve as inducements to action by affecting the direction, intensity and duration of a set of actions.</s><s xml:id="_4XXzAd9">The most basic and longstanding distinction that characterizes motivated behavior distinguishes actions of approach and avoidance that are elicited by appetitive and aversive factors, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Thorndike, 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Watson, 1913;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Skinner, 1938;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Higgins, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hD4r2a3">Motivation can thus direct actions toward or away from objects associated with high or low subjective utility (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Elliot, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braver et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FyVygEA">Although this association suggests that motivational drive is related to the hedonic experience of action outcomes and thus to emotional experience, the two concepts can be distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berridge and Robinson, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZUyrWbR">Both humans and non-human animals may display motivated actions in the absence of hedonic reactions to the outcome (referred to as 'liking'), and conversely experience hedonic reactions in the absence of motivational drive (referred to as 'wanting'), and the two states have been suggested to involve different brain systems (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berridge, 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_54Vq4Yx">For research using natural stimuli, it is therefore important to separately control for the motivational drive elicited by objects and object-related emotional reactions.</s><s xml:id="_dB7VQGn">An additional, largely separate aspect is the frequency with which objects are encountered in daily life.</s><s xml:id="_7S5yfNg">Lower frequency may lead to reduced recognizability, which would make the ratings less interpretable.</s></p><p xml:id="_yYvRBdg"><s xml:id="_TEEtpaH">Studies using realistic motivational stimuli have been scarce.</s><s xml:id="_CbzxD7z">Here we introduce a new picture database, Motivational Objects in Natural Scenes (MONS).</s><s xml:id="_P6cYANk">805 objects were taken from newly photographed natural scenes intended for experimental use.</s><s xml:id="_9xhfDyg">Objects have been shown to elicit strong motivational effects in consumer settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Elliott, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Seva et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cohen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alba and Williams, 2013)</ref>, findings that are supported by recent fMRI evidence on product-related decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Knutson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chib et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_pKh87D2"><s xml:id="_kskQBaK">These studies and existing databases mostly used isolated objects, motivating the natural-scene database presented here.</s><s xml:id="_7uBjtWn">The term natural scenes is often used to refer to realistic scenes that we could encounter in every-day life <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hart et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Marx et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stoll et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wze7Dtr">At the same time, low-level physical properties of a scene influence visual processing and guidance of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Awh et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hkHjHan">Hence, we aimed to control for low-level visual properties by photographing each scene at least three times, each time replacing one object ("critical object") in the scene to create versions with varying motivational value (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for an example).</s><s xml:id="_UKNC7yk">Although scenes photographed in this way may still look slightly artificial as compared to our typically cluttered environment, they are still composed of real objects.</s><s xml:id="_5RNDjA5">Indeed, such scenes with nicely arranged objects are actually quite common in everyday life, for example in shop displays.</s><s xml:id="_PxbmMAs">The scene creation procedure also allowed us to maintain a high level of visual similarity between scenes and objects while varying their motivational properties.</s><s xml:id="_rsCMR6F">In addition to the critical object, each scene contains one to six additional neutral objects.</s><s xml:id="_5T3AcYt">On the basis of the motivational ratings, the images were categorized as appetitive, neutral, and aversive.</s></p><p xml:id="_yFcSeTf"><s xml:id="_6xarY9c">We acquired ratings for the objects isolated from the scenes presented on a white background using online questionnaires and separate ratings for the critical objects presented in their scene context.</s><s xml:id="_vdWAE2e">Each object was rated on three scales intended to measure different aspects of motivation and three scales measuring possible confounding factors.</s><s xml:id="_kBnSdZh">In addition, we obtained ratings for the entire scenes.</s></p><p xml:id="_ugFCfP7"><s xml:id="_hV9ZR6n">Because of the diversity of objects in the database, we designed three scales to capture the main aspects of motivation.</s><s xml:id="_g5qV95K">Although the three scales were expected to measure a single dimensionmotivation -we reasoned that the motivational properties of some objects might be captured better by only one or two of the scales.</s><s xml:id="_pGqt542">The action component that defines motivation was therefore measured by two scales assessing the wish to interact with an object (Interaction scale) and whether to approach or avoid (Approach/Avoid scale) the object.</s><s xml:id="_uPhKCAZ">Note that the term interaction may be broadly interpreted, reflecting the typical action associated with an object (e.g., eating in the case of food, and viewing in the case of a painting).</s><s xml:id="_2jaWG8J">Although the two scales overlap in many cases, ratings may differ for some objects (for example, one may not wish to interact with a musical instrument if one cannot play it, but one may wish to approach it to hear others play).</s><s xml:id="_WZNaKqa">Related to this action component of motivation is the distinction between objects that are typically associated with passive or active behavior.</s><s xml:id="_xhsBhu8">A clear perception-action link, also referred to as affordance, will probably lead to approach and interaction behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gibson, 1979)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n2kJy9S">No affordance scale was included in order to keep the number of ratings manageable for subjects, but our interaction and approach/avoidance scales may have partly captured this concept.</s></p><p xml:id="_ExzEsBV"><s xml:id="_sw6z5tk">The third motivational scale addressed the component of wanting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berridge et al., 2009)</ref> by measuring how much participants desired to own the object (Desire to Own scale).</s><s xml:id="_7DemGQP">For many objects, this scale will be correlated with the other two scales.</s><s xml:id="_UvWekGc">However, in some cases the scales may differ (e.g., one may wish to interact with a park bench by sitting on it, but may not wish to own it; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for all scale questions).</s></p><p xml:id="_dmGbWre"><s xml:id="_ZBr5TZh">We aimed to control for the affective properties of the objects.</s><s xml:id="_y5qGMkV">The selected objects were intended to vary more widely in motivational value than in their emotional impact.</s><s xml:id="_VkFuR2M">Widely accepted dimensional theories of emotion generally divide the affective space into the two dimensions valence and arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Russell, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lang et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cC2wpcP">Two scales measuring Valence and Arousal were therefore included in the ratings.</s><s xml:id="_5TWyn8k">An additional scale was included to control for recognizability of the objects (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martin et al., 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NxtV6u6"><s xml:id="_h7eDNw6">The purpose of the current database is to provide vision researchers and cognitive neuroscientists with a controlled stimulus set consisting of realistic natural scenes and everyday objects.</s><s xml:id="_bde5qxg">The database will allow scientists to use stimuli with controlled ratings on motivation, valence, arousal, or recognizability when one of these dimensions is relevant in their experiment.</s><s xml:id="_JPbaPHA">The database can be used to select motivationally neutral stimuli, for example to exclude motivational influences in memory tasks, as well as to select appetitive or aversive stimuli, for example in studies of visual attention.</s><s xml:id="_NjrRgye">Vision scientists may be especially interested in our natural scene set, as the scenes were controlled in terms of visual characteristics (see above), and we provide exact object locations within the scenes.</s></p><p xml:id="_kNHAu2w"><s xml:id="_4r78Cm8">To support a range of experimental uses, we collected ratings on the isolated objects, on the objects in the scenes and on the scenes as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_sugZ6sz">For each set of ratings, we conducted a principal component analysis.</s><s xml:id="_h6XQrHY">Please note: Throughout the text, we will refer to the motivational categories as appetitive, neutral and aversive, in contrast to the valence ratings, which we will refer to as positive and negative or low and high in valence.</s></p></div>

current confound between motivational ratings and valence may be a natural consequence of the connection between emotion and motivation in the real world.</s><s xml:id="_6F6cRVU">However, this association was mostly found in the PCA and is only weakly reflected in the category means, where both aversive and neutral motivational objects were rated in the neutral range on valence and appetitive objects were rated as only slightly above the neutral range on valence.</s><s xml:id="_3qJduMq">Moreover, although there was a general link between valence and motivation, individual objects deviated from this general pattern.</s><s xml:id="_puJ9PAm">Researchers interested in separating the effects of valence and motivation could therefore select those images in which valence and motivation ratings differed the most.</s><s xml:id="_rFy2M7b">For example, a medicine bottle, bag of cat litter and banana peel were rated as neutral on valence, but quite aversively on motivation.</s><s xml:id="_MnnKVz6">Vice versa, a kitchen knife, toilet paper and an umbrella were rated quite low on valence, but rather high on motivation.</s><s xml:id="_M3M2S76">These differences

maybe through an attentional mechanism.</s><s xml:id="_sCaqFYa">Another possibility is that recognizability affected the subjective quality ratings, as a positive correlation between recognizability and the subjective quality ratings, but not the objective quality assessment was found.</s><s xml:id="_sBgC3T6">Maybe participants based their quality estimate partly on whether they recognized the object.</s><s xml:id="_NDkQbar">Users of the database may want to use either the quality or recognizability measures when selecting images for their research, or include these measures in their analyses.</s><s xml:id="_U889ra5">The object ratings were not strongly affected by the presentation of the objects in isolation or in the scenes, supported by the consistent PCA results and by significant correlations between object ratings in isolation and object ratings in the scenes.</s><s xml:id="_9FN2Qtf">Even though we controlled for the visual features when creating the scenes, the
