become ubiquitous.</s><s xml:id="_ZMU2s9c">Once a term used to describe the renovation of modest mews houses in London <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Glass 1964)</ref>, it is now vernacular used to describe any number of cultural transformations with apparent class dimensions.</s><s xml:id="_3SXZDV9">Ironically, within urban studies an extended application of gentrification theory has been actively resisted.</s><s xml:id="_paEqxfn">In this journal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ghertner (2015)</ref> argued that gentrification theory fails in much of the world, its conceptual basis being firmly planted in a particular regulatory and political context.</s><s xml:id="_zQ2f2uM">While Ghertner's position is has been criticized (Lo ´pez-Morales 2015), his arguments are part of a wider move to make gentrification theory compatible with postcolonial scholarship <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lees, Shin, and Lo ´pez-Morales 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_72AcNpf">This issue's special feature examines Beirut's recent redevelopment and asks what parts of gentrification theory we might be able to use in this distinctive urban setting.</s><s xml:id="_bBtMuP9">For Ashkar, the distinction that Ghertner (2015) introduces is dispensed with, the argument being that we must look beyond a Global North/Global South distinction to see the fundamental political and economic processes that generate a rent gap.</s><s xml:id="_Xm9xaTZ">Fawaz et al. and Marot argue this does not mean overlooking the regulatory and legal structures within which the political and economic processes of the rent gap operate.</s><s xml:id="_2EpNpb7">Rather they claim we must seek to understand the ways in which regulatory and legal structures condition rent gap formation, seeing them as actively conditioning conjunctural (see Peck 2017) land and property market processes.</s></p><p xml:id="_Eq6Qcez"><s xml:id="_qebZhaK">This nuanced analysis of conjunctural urban processes is a critical contribution made collectively by the four papers on Beirut's gentrification.</s><s xml:id="_veQQ3b5">The papers show the ways regulatory and legal structures shape the city's gentrification.</s><s xml:id="_QPtzAfS">Furthermore, by exploring how gentrification in Beirut emerges from a particular context, the papers offer an important commentary on the Lebanese state's role in fostering the relationship between private and public domains and how actually-existing practices involve little meaningful commitment to democratic politics.</s></p><p xml:id="_KfSgB8p"><s xml:id="_GCnFMuK">Across all four papers, the close relationship between real estate developers and investors and the city's political elite is central.</s><s xml:id="_X7EdPeJ">The state, controlled by the political elite, has been drawn into a relationship that facilitates the interests of capital seeking to profit from the exploitation of Beirut's rent gaps.</s><s xml:id="_52WWU5a">This facilitation is multi-faceted.</s><s xml:id="_e4zFZAN">Ashkar describes how Lebanese law has been used to enable appropriation, dispossession and the removal of counter-claims.</s><s xml:id="_wS3uHMc">Famaz et al. follow a similar line of inquiry, showing how systems of property exchange create the conditions for forcible acquisition and the removal of tenant organizations.</s><s xml:id="_n989uVF">For Khechen, these manipulations of state power are indicative of deeper social inequalities, gentrification demonstrating the concentrations of power that have long shaped Lebanon and Beirut.</s><s xml:id="_F29uW3Q">The collection of papers therefore urge us to read Beirut's gentrification as a reflection of embedded, historically-located economic and political processes.</s><s xml:id="_zTxsERz">In this framing, gentrification is an outcome of state power being used and manipulated for a specific set of private interests.</s><s xml:id="_uc78ep5">The commodification of housing in Beirut is then not only problematic because it displaces and evicts poor and working-class communities.</s><s xml:id="_ZuHQKRv">We must also extend our critique to encompass an appreciation of how commodification serves, in a completely unambiguous way, undemocratic ends.</s><s xml:id="_FZP9GGw">Public and private interests are not organized to facilitate a democratic social order.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZYU9VsZ"><s xml:id="_dMcZJdh">One might then be tempted to understand Beirut's gentrification as being caused, at least in part, by a 'weak state' that is unable to control the city's capitalist interests.</s><s xml:id="_xZMyYHA">Yet the papers' other common theme, the lack of mechanisms to enable representation and contestation, provides pause for thought.</s><s xml:id="_ZhdWjN8">Marot describes a core contradiction in Beirut's political structure.</s><s xml:id="_3v7Q5nP">The Lebanese state has been unable to provide citizens with basic social services, yet it has successfully directed vast amounts of foreign investment into Beirut's property markets.</s><s xml:id="_6RfnXP3">Despite Beirut's turbulent past and regional volatilities, the promised returns from real estate investment in Lebanon have attracted huge capital inflows.</s><s xml:id="_NVt3VfV">Old, low-rise buildings have been ripped down and replaced with hastily constructed high-rise condos.</s><s xml:id="_nNdmRES">Where residents have contested this disruptive gentrification, the state has conditioned legal and political processes to limit resident protest movements.</s><s xml:id="_9Kt6VDa">The papers describe Beirut's gentrification as necessitating a coordinated process of disenfranchisement, where displaced and excluded residents are actively engineered out of the city's political process.</s><s xml:id="_NbpTpwh">We again find a state forcibly pushing citizens out of the institutions intended to facilitate democratic public life.</s></p><p xml:id="_E9FfYMy"><s xml:id="_jns5RBV">We can certainly describe this as yet more privatization of the public realm; a locallyconditioned neoliberal transformation where the reconstruction of the urban process provides a foundation for accumulation.</s><s xml:id="_qE9vBps">Yet something else might need to be said.</s><s xml:id="_wvfRcGD">In particular, and reflecting on Constant and Rancie `re's thoughts, we might argue that the trend toward an elevated private and diminished public is not key here.</s><s xml:id="_7An5fYq">Rather, any pretense to the fine balance between public and private interests that
